# World Downloader Forge
## First time setup
Unzip the latest **Src** bundle from [files.minecraftforge.net](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) into this folder.

## Updating to newer Forge versions
In the file **build.gradle** change the version number in line 25 to the latest one listed on [files.minecraftforge.net](http://files.minecraftforge.net/)  
For example:

    version = "1.7.10-10.13.0.1156"

The first part is the Minecraft version and the second part is the Forge version.  
There is no need to download the latest version! The commands in the next section do this automatically.

## After first time setup and after each update
* Open a command window in this folder (Windows: Shift+Click -> "Open command window here")
* Run command: `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`
* Run command: `gradlew eclipse`

## Building the mod
* Open a command window in this folder (Windows: Shift+Click -> "Open command window here")
* Run command: `gradlew build`
* The jar file containing the mod can be found in the subfolder **build/libs**

## Other gradle "tasks"
`gradlew tasks`
